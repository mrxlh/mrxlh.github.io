####  倒排索引核心原理

比如我们目前有两个语句

doc1：I really liked my small dogs, and I think my mom also liked them.
doc2：He never liked any dogs, so I hope that my mom will not expect me to liked him.

分词，初步的倒排索引的建立

| word   | doc1 | doc2 |
| ------ | ---- | ---- |
| I      | *    | *    |
| really | *    |      |
| liked  | *    | *    |
| my     | *    | *    |
| small  | *    |      |
| dogs   | *    |      |
| and    | *    |      |
| think  | *    |      |
| mom    | *    | *    |
| also   | *    |      |
| them   | *    |      |
| He     | *    |      |
| never  |      | *    |
| any    | *    |      |
| so     | *    |      |
| hope   |      | *    |
| that   | *    |      |
| will   | *    |      |
| not    | *    |      |
| expect |      | *    |
| me     | *    |      |
| to     | *    |      |
| him    | *    |      |

演示了一下倒排索引最简单的建立的一个过程

搜索

如果搜索 该文案:mother like little dog，没有搜索到任何结果,则

mother
like
little
dog

这个是不是我们想要的搜索结果？？？绝对不是，因为在我们看来，mother和mom有区别吗？同义词，都是妈妈的意思。like和liked有区别吗？没有，都是喜欢的意思，只不过一个是现在时，一个是过去时。little和small有区别吗？同义词，都是小小的。dog和dogs有区别吗？狗，只不过一个是单数，一个是复数。

normalization，建立倒排索引的时候，会执行一个操作，也就是说对拆分出的各个单词进行相应的处理，以提升后面搜索的时候能够搜索到相关联的文档的概率

normalization 可以对分析进行  时态的转换，单复数的转换，同义词的转换，大小写的转换 等等操作.

eg: 

mom —> mother
liked —> like
small —> little
dogs —> dog

重新建立倒排索引，加入normalization，再次用mother liked little dog搜索，就可以搜索到了



| word   | doc1 | doc2 | normalization    |
| ------ | ---- | ---- | ---------------- |
| I      | *    | *    |                  |
| really | *    |      |                  |
| liked  | *    | *    | liked --> like   |
| my     | *    | *    |                  |
| small  | *    |      | small --> little |
| dogs   | *    |      | dogs --> dog     |
| and    | *    |      |                  |
| think  | *    |      |                  |
| mom    | *    | *    |                  |
| also   | *    |      |                  |
| them   | *    |      |                  |
| He     | *    |      |                  |
| never  |      | *    |                  |
| any    | *    |      |                  |
| so     | *    |      |                  |
| hope   |      | *    |                  |
| that   | *    |      |                  |
| will   | *    |      |                  |
| not    | *    |      |                  |
| expect |      | *    |                  |
| me     | *    |      |                  |
| to     | *    |      |                  |
| him    | *    |      |                  |

当用 该文案进行搜索的时候, mother like little dog，es 会对改文档进行分词，并执行normalization

mother	 --> mom
like	         --> like
little	         --> little
dog	         --> dog

这个时候 doc1和doc2都会搜索出来

doc1：I really liked my small dogs, and I think my mom also liked them.
doc2：He never liked any dogs, so I hope that my mom will not expect me to liked him.
